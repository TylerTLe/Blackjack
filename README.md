# Blackjack

This repository provides a complete implementation of the popular card game, Blackjack, using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap. <br>

The objective of Blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand without going over a total hand value of 21.

# Card Values: <br>
    Number cards (2-10): Face value. 
    Face cards (J, Q, K): Each worth 10.
    Ace (A): Worth either 1 or 11, depending on the player's choice.

# The Dealer's Play: <br>
When the dealer has served every player, the dealers face-down card is turned up. If the total is 17 or more, it must stand. If the total is 16 or under, they must take a card. The dealer must continue to take cards until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand. If the dealer has an ace, and counting it as 11 would bring the total to 17 or more (but not over 21), the dealer must count the ace as 11 and stand. The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.
